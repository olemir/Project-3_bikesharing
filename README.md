# About the Project
In this project I investigate a bikesharing data set of capital bike share from Washington D.C.
Capital Bikeshare is a state owned company that aims to maximize the use of its bikesharing products; profits are secondary.

## Capital Bikeshare Business Model
- How to rent a bycicle?
 - bikesharing with stationlogic where poeple have to hand back their bike
 - they may leave their bike outside of a station, but will be charged a fee
- The company also offers memberships, where users can lend bycicles at a lower rate and enjoy other premium features.


## Business Case
With environmental issues and health becoming trending topics, the usage of bicycles as a mode of transportation has gained popularity in recent years. 
To encourage bike usage, cities across the world have successfully implemented bike-sharing programs. 
Under such schemes, riders can rent bicycles using manual/automated kiosks spread across the city for defined periods. 
In most cases, riders can pick up bikes from one location and return them to any other designated place.

Bike riders reduce traffic congestion as they form a valid substitution for cars on short/medium trips, contribute to the use of public transport by providing effective last-mile connectivity, and simply take up less space on the road. 
The characteristics of data being generated by these systems also make an attractive option for researchers who can try to understand traffic routes in a city.

## Aims of this Project
The aim of this data analysis is to get valuable insights on the company's performance and proceedings on it#s goals.
The company's regular survey reveals the user's priorities.
The analysis aims to understand if the company addresses those needs effectively.
Furthermore, a model to forecast the demand for bicycles shall be created.

# The Data Set
- All rides from 2021 - 2023
- hourly weather data for the whole service area
